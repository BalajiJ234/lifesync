## Future Possibilities 🔮
**Timeline**: 6+ months
**Status**: Exploratory

### Optional End-to-End Encrypted Sync
**Privacy-Preserving Cloud Backup**

**Concept**:
- User generates encryption key (stored locally)
- Data encrypted on device
- Encrypted data uploaded to cloud (optional, opt-in)
- Only user can decrypt (zero-knowledge)
- Still works fully offline

**Requirements**:
- Must be 100% opt-in
- Must be end-to-end encrypted
- User controls encryption keys
- App works without it
- Open source crypto implementation

**Status**: Research phase - only if demand warrants complexity

### Community Pattern Sharing
**Anonymized AI Improvement**

**Concept**:
- Users opt-in to share categorization patterns (anonymized)
- "Carrefour → Groceries" shared (no amounts, no personal data)
- Community benefits from collective learning
- Fully transparent and optional

**Privacy**:
- Opt-in only
- Anonymized keywords only (no expenses, no amounts)
- User reviews before sharing
- Can opt-out anytime

**Status**: Concept only - privacy review needed

## Not on Roadmap ❌

### Will NOT Implement
- ❌ Cloud sync without encryption
- ❌ User accounts / authentication
- ❌ Social features
- ❌ Advertising
- ❌ Data monetization
- ❌ External AI APIs (unless opt-in)
- ❌ Analytics / tracking
- ❌ Bank account integration (privacy risk)
- ❌ Premium tiers / paid features

**Reason**: Against privacy-first philosophy
