As a user with unique spending habits, I want to create my own expense categories so that I can track expenses that donâ€™t fit standard categories.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create custom category (name + icon)
- [ ] Custom categories appear in the expense form
- [ ] Edit custom category name and icon
- [ ] Delete only if category has no assigned expenses
- [ ] Persist custom categories in localStorage
- [ ] Default categories remain protected

Notes:
- Reuse icon set from /public/icons
- Provide fallback icon for missing selections
