As a savings-focused user, I want LifeSync to highlight opportunities to reduce spending so that I can make smarter financial decisions without exposing my data.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Analyze recurring and discretionary expenses to suggest actionable savings tips (e.g., "Subscriptions increased 20% vs last month")
- [ ] Provide estimated monthly savings if suggestion is adopted
- [ ] Allow marking suggestions as completed, snoozed, or dismissed
- [ ] Suggestions operate entirely offline and store data locally
- [ ] Integrate with goals module to show impact on goal timelines
- [ ] Include suggestions in export/import data sets

Notes:
- Use difference between category spend vs historical averages to surface opportunities
- Consider ranking suggestions by potential savings impact
- Display suggestions on dashboard and goals pages
