As a household manager, I want a shared budget mode so that multiple people in my home can track expenses together while still keeping data private to each device.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Provide optional "household mode" where members share a common budget structure
- [ ] Allow exporting/importing shared budget pack (JSON) to sync between devices manually
- [ ] Track individual contributions and display consolidated totals
- [ ] Support assigning expenses to household members while keeping data local
- [ ] Integrate with bill splitting to reconcile household shared costs
- [ ] Provide guidance for recommended sync workflow (e.g., weekly manual exchange)

Notes:
- Ensure exported shared budget pack is encrypted if global encryption is enabled
- Offer conflict resolution suggestions when merging changes
- Keep UI accessible for non-technical family members
