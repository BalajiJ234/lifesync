As a goal-driven user, I want to manage multiple savings goals at the same time so that I can balance priorities without losing track of progress.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Support creating and tracking at least five active goals simultaneously
- [ ] Provide overview screen showing progress, target date, and status for each goal
- [ ] Allow prioritising goals (drag and drop or priority field)
- [ ] Ensure progress calculations and AI insights update per goal independently
- [ ] Include filtering/sorting (priority, completion percentage, due date)
- [ ] Persist all data locally and include in export/import

Notes:
- Update goal slice to handle multiple records gracefully
- Coordinate with dashboard widgets to highlight top goals
- Consider color-coding or grouping by priority
