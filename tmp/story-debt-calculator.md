As someone repaying debt, I want a payoff calculator so that I can understand how different strategies affect my payoff timeline using my local data only.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Support entering multiple debts with balance, interest rate, minimum payment
- [ ] Offer snowball and avalanche strategies with projected payoff dates
- [ ] Allow user to simulate extra payments and see impact instantly
- [ ] Calculations run locally without external services
- [ ] Persist scenarios and include in export/import files
- [ ] Provide recommended strategy summary with explanation

Notes:

- Consider visual timeline or chart for payoff projection
- Provide warnings for input validation (e.g., payment less than interest)
