As a transparency-focused user, I want a privacy dashboard that explains what data LifeSync stores so that I can verify nothing is tracked or transmitted without my consent.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add dedicated "Privacy Transparency" section in Settings
- [ ] Show clear breakdown of what data types exist and where they are stored (localStorage/IndexedDB)
- [ ] Display live status of network requests (e.g., "0 external requests")
- [ ] Provide controls/shortcuts to export, import, or clear data
- [ ] Link to PRIVACY.md and relevant documentation from within the app
- [ ] Works offline and updates dynamically as features are enabled/disabled

Notes:
- Consider including verification tips (e.g., how to inspect DevTools network)
- Ensure copy matches commitments in PRIVACY.md
- Provide accessibility-friendly layout and plain-language explanations
